Your name, as well as any photo you submit through the registration process, will be publicly displayed as part of your account profile.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Public Content:</strong> The information that you contribute through the Site is intended for public consumption, including Your Content (as defined in the Terms) reviews, photos, comments, events, and account profile. We may display this information through the Service, share it with Theaters, and further distribute it to a wider audience through third party sites and services.</li>
<li><strong>Communications:</strong> When you sign up for an account or use certain features, you are opting to receive messages from other Theater Engine users, companies, theatrical productions, venues, and Theater Engine itself. You can manage some of your messaging preferences, but note that you cannot opt out of receiving certain administrative, transactional, or legal messages from Theater Engine.

If you exchange messages with others through the Service, we may store them in order to process and deliver them, allow you to manage them, and we may review and disclose them in connection with investigations related to the operation and use of the Service. Although we do not and cannot monitor all transmissions, we may not deliver messages that we believe are objectionable, such as spam messages or requests to exchange reviews for compensation. We may also store information that you provide through communications to us, including from phone calls, letters, emails and other electronic messages, or in person. If you are a Theater listed on Theater Engine, we may contact you, including by phone or email, using the contact information you provide us, make publicly available, or that we have on record for your business.</li>

<p><strong>COOKIES</strong></p>
<p>We, and third parties with whom we partner, may use cookies, web beacons, tags, scripts, local shared objects such as HTML5 and Flash (sometimes called &ldquo;flash cookies&rdquo;), advertising identifiers (including mobile identifiers such as Apple&rsquo;s IDFA or Google&rsquo;s Advertising ID) and similar technology (<strong>&ldquo;Cookies&rdquo;</strong>) in connection with your use of the Service, third party websites, and mobile applications. Cookies may have unique identifiers, and reside, among other places, on your computer or mobile device, in emails we send to you, and on our web pages. Cookies may transmit information about you and your use of the Service, such as your browser type, search preferences, IP address, data relating to advertisements that have been displayed to you or that you have clicked on, and the date and time of your use.

The method for disabling Cookies may vary by device and browser, but can usually be found in preferences or security settings. For example, iOS and Android devices each have settings which are designed to limit forms of ad tracking. Please note that changing any of these settings does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you.</p>
<p><strong>THIRD PARTIES</strong></p>
<p>Third parties may receive information about you as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Advertisers:</strong> We may allow third parties to use Cookies through the Site to collect the same type of information for the same purposes as Theater Engine does for itself. Third parties may be able to associate the information they collect with other information they have about you from other sources. Please note that opting out of Cookies does not prevent the display of all advertisements to you. Additionally, we may share non-personally identifiable information from or about you with third parties, such as location data, advertising identifiers, or a cryptographic hash of a common account identifier (such as an email address), to facilitate the display of targeted advertising. You may be able to limit our sharing of some of this information through your mobile device settings, as described above.</li>
<li><strong>Site Providers:</strong> We may rely on third party providers to perform certain services for us in connection with your use of the Service, such as communications and hosting services, network security, technical and customer support, tracking and reporting functions, quality assurance testing, payment processing, our own marketing of the Service, and other functions. We may share information from or about you with these third party providers so that they can perform their services. These third party providers may share information with us that they obtain from or about you in connection with providing their services. Third party providers may also share this information with their subsidiaries, joint ventures, or other companies under common control. Some of our web pages may utilize framing techniques to serve content to you from our third party providers, while preserving the look and feel of the Service. In such cases, please note that the information you provide may be provided to the third party.</li>

<li><strong>Business Transfers:</strong> We may share information from or about you with other companies under common control, in which case we will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. If another company acquires Theater Engine or all or substantially all of our assets, that company will possess the same information, and will assume the rights and obligations with respect to that information as described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>Investigations:</strong> We may investigate and disclose information from or about you if we have a good faith belief that such investigation or disclosure (a) is reasonably necessary to comply with legal process and law enforcement instructions and orders, such as a search warrant, subpoena, statute, judicial proceeding, or other legal process served on us; (b) is helpful to prevent, investigate, or identify possible wrongdoing in connection with the Service; or (c) protects our rights, reputation, property, or that of our users, affiliates, or the public.&nbsp;</li>

Except as set forth in the Terms or this Policy, we do not share your personal information with them, and are not responsible for their privacy practices.

</ol>
<p><strong>CONTROLLING YOUR PERSONAL DATA</strong></p>
<p>Other users may be able to identify you, or associate you with your account, if you include personal information in the content you post publicly. You can reduce the risk of being personally identified by using the Site pseudonymously, though doing so could detract from the credibility of your contributions to the Service.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please also note that the messages you send or receive using the Site are only private to the extent that both you and the person you are communicating with keep them private. For example, if you send a message to another user, that user may choose to publicly post it. Also, Theater Engine may access and disclose such messages in the course of investigations relating to use of the Service.</p>
<p><strong>DATA RETENTION AND ACCOUNT TERMINATION</strong></p>
<p>You can close your account. We will remove your public posts from view and/or dissociate them from your account profile, but we may retain information about you for the purposes authorized under this Privacy Policy unless prohibited by law.
